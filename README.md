# Modified Void Descriptor Function (mVDF)

The modified void descriptor function (VDF) that improves upon pore-related metrics commonly reported in the literature by simultaneously accounting for pore sizes, pore shapes, pore clustering, pore-pore interaction, and pore locations relative to free surfaces of the specimen.

The modified VDF is a tool written in Python that is able to calculate the VDF value given a pore network file and some parameters pertaining to the specimen.
